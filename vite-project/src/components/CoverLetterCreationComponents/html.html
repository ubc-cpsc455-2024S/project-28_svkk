The opportunity to tackle real-world issues and challenges with novel and emerging technologies aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. My background in developing secured web applications and my proactive approach to debugging and testing ensure that I am well-prepared to contribute effectively in this role.</p><p>My technical skill set includes proficient use of <strong>Java, C/C++, TypeScript/JavaScript</strong>, with comprehensive projects showcasing my capability to handle end-to-end software development. Notably, my project, InsightUBC, involved developing a robust database for querying UBC course and geological room data using <strong>TypeScript and JavaScript</strong> with a <strong>REST API.</strong> This experience honed my skills in employing RESTful services and ensuring data security through solid design principles. Additionally, I have demonstrated my ability to work effectively in team settings through various academic and personal projects. My role in developing a Tourism Application using <strong>PHP, HTML, and SQL </strong>involved coordinating with teammates to design and deploy a secure website for user interactions. These experiences, combined with my exceptional ability to learn new technologies, will help me transition and excel in this role within a short time.</p><p>I am particularly drawn to this role at UBC CIC because of the unique challenges associated with coding and developing CIC project prototypes and applications, producing technical and end-user documentation, and presenting solutions to the CIC team and clients/sponsors. The opportunity to gain experience and exposure to AWS, cloud computing, and Amazon's innovation processes is incredibly motivating. In addition to my technical skills, I have developed strong communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and organizational skills through volunteering and professional work experiences. For instance, in group projects such as developing the Tourism Application, I collaborated closely with teammates, ensuring effective communication and coordination to achieve our objectives. My role often involved organizing tasks, facilitating meetings, and ensuring that all team members were aligned, enhancing my ability to work effectively in a team setting. My experience in the Ben Matthews lab at UBC for directed studies required meticulous organization and clear communication to accurately collect and analyze data, further demonstrating my ability to manage complex tasks and collaborate effectively with others.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm align with the goals of your team. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at 604-928-7133 or k2i1b@ugrad.cs.ubc.ca, or through the Co-op office at Interviews@sciencecoop.ubc.ca if you have any questions or want to set up an interview.</p><p>Warm regards,<br />Kevin Poon</p>
